# GDPR and its Impact on the Automotive Sector
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law implemented by the European Union (EU) in May 2018. It sets guidelines for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data of individuals within the EU and European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR aims to protect individuals' privacy by giving them greater control over their personal data, enforcing transparency, and holding organizations accountable for ensuring data security. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties, including fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company's global annual revenue.

It plays a crucial role in shaping how the automotive sector handles personal data, particularly with the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles. Here’s a brief overview of its key impacts:

### Data Collection & Consent
Automakers collect significant data from vehicles (e.g., location, driving habits). GDPR mandates that data collection must be minimized, used for specific purposes, and consent must be obtained from users before gathering personal data.

### User Rights
GDPR provides individuals with rights such as data access, correction, deletion ("right to be forgotten"), and portability. This gives users more control over the data generated by their vehicles.

### Telematics & Security
Connected vehicles require automakers to ensure data is anonymized and securely stored to prevent breaches. Robust security measures are essential to protect user data.

### Compliance & Accountability
Automotive companies must appoint Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to ensure they are adhering to GDPR. Record-keeping is essential to demonstrate compliance.

### Penalties
Non-compliance with GDPR can result in heavy fines (up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue), making it a critical priority for automakers.

## Impact on close future and present
GDPR compels the automotive sector to handle personal data responsibly, ensuring transparency, security, and user control, particularly in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles.
This means they need to take action to properly collect, handle, and protect european's data. This may have some positive points like:
* More investment on cybersecurity to protect data and infrastructure,
* Reinforcement of access control to data on vehicles,
* Better handling of data, collecting only needed one and not everything possible to monetize user's data.

On the other hand some negative points are:
* WIth higher investments, prices on EU may go bit higher than in other zones,
* Lower innovation due to added costs in vehicles for EU and need to increase cybersecurity constraints,
* Feautres not available in EU, to avoid collecting some data and reduce risks.
